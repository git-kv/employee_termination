# Employee Termination
Application that adds user information to a csv list of termed employees that is periodically processed to perform account disablement actions.
This is a collection of applications and scripts used to process employee terminations.

The main application is setup to be available for use by both IT and HR staff, allowing immetiate terminations to be initiated by HR in instances where IT staff are otherwise occupied.

The immediate termination and scheduled termination processes are configured to ignore some steps for important accounts such as leadership and IT employees to prevent complications if one of these accounts were accidentally targeted.
